						I am afraid I have to disagree. I believe policymakers play an
						essential role in overall national development and should not be
						chosen by a common man. Consider a situation when a small kid got
						some disease and having stomach pain. What should you do? Should you
						go to an expert like a doctor or let that kid decide for himself? If
						he thinks eating chocolate will make him feel better even if he has
						diabetes and can die due to it? My claim is that policy is a much
						intellectually demanding thing; One cannot do this as time pass. One
						must have enough knowledge to comment on them.<br /><br />
						A person who does his job most of the time and gains knowledge about
						what current government is doing or what leaders are doing from
						newspapers (with practically biased statistics or no data at all).
						Furthermore, he will be choosing who is going to make policy. So
						what do you expect to happen? In the end, the person who manages his
						Twitter profile well or can give a better speech and in the worst
						case, who can pay a lot wins the election. <br /><br />
						We can change this. Let us consider a scenario when policymakers are
						elected by a group of experts from various fields, and those who are
						elected are also experts in the field. Who can evaluate the
						performance and understand the data. At this moment, half of the
						Indian population is against farm bills, and half is in against.
						Should there be a notion of subjectivity in this where data can
						clearly make a difference if the bill is against the farmer or in
						the favor? Even if there is subjectivity due to uncertainty in the
						future or lack of data, intellectual assumptions can be made and
						verified. There is no point in the current scenario. I tried my best
						to understand what the bill is saying and whether it favors or is
						against it. But I failed. It is not easy to claim on certain
						assumptions to claim to be valid or invalid. And that's where I was
						surprised. How are so many people on the roads claiming something
						about them? I do not doubt their intellect, but considering the
						current status of Indians in the global market, it's hard to believe
						any of them even understand them. I am not saying I understand them
						and make fun of others who are in favor or against them. The only
						thing I am saying is there are considerable people on both sides.
						Considerable of them must be wrong<br /><br />
						And that's where I found the problem with the system. Why common
						people should be given the right to speak something upon which they
						don't understand. People just don't have enough resources and time
						to figure it. Half knowledge is dangerous than no knowledge.<br /><br />
						Form an institution that is independent of everything. Make it
						private. Private institutions are better at handling corruption and
						unfairness compared to government. Give them enough rights to
						question everything and let them recruit some of the best in their
						respective fields. They will be the auditor of the government. Not
						common people. What common people can do is make a request to the
						auditors about the claim that they feel is inappropriate. Such an
						auditing system will audit every government policy, and everything
						government does. If it fails to achieve "Vikas," let the auditors
						who are intelligent enough to judge the effects can comment if its
						"acche din" or smokescreen by IT cell.<br /><br />
					</p>
					<h1 class="text-gray-100 text-2xl pt-3 pb-1">Conclusion</h1>
					<p class="text-gray-400 text-xl pb-10">
						ordinary people should not be allowed to judge the performance of
						any policy or government. Preferably there should be an intellectual
						body of respected people from various institutions who can evaluate.
						We common people busy in everyday activities do not have enough
						resources and knowledge to do so.
